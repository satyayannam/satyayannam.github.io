        <p class="tagline">Biometric Identity Verification using Palm-Line Topology</p>
        <p class="description">
          This project is a research-driven initiative to create a palm-line based biometric recognition system using computer vision, feature engineering, and privacy-first security protocols. Unlike facial or fingerprint biometrics, palm-line patterns are less intrusive, harder to replicate, and ideal for sensitive domains like healthcare and defense.

        <h2 class="section-title">🔍 The Problem We're Solving</h2>
        <p>Facial recognition systems have become widespread — but they come with high risks: spoofing attacks, surveillance misuse, and identity theft. Our approach replaces facial data with palm biometrics, which are contactless, private, and cryptographically securable through keypoint hashing.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">🧠 Technical Stack</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Python + OpenCV:</strong> Image capture, contour filtering, palm line segmentation</li>
          <li><strong>Keypoint Detection:</strong> ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated BRIEF) descriptors to extract unique line junctions</li>
          <li><strong>Contour Mapping:</strong> Convex hulls, ridge line curvature, and geometric normalization</li>
          <li><strong>Feature Matching:</strong> BruteForce + Hamming Distance (ORB) and FLANN (optional)</li>
          <li><strong>Anti-Spoofing:</strong> Liveness check based on hand movement + depth map estimation (Planned)</li>
          <li><strong>Biometric Hashing:</strong> SHA256+ feature vectors to create anonymized identity signatures</li>
          <li><strong>Frontend:</strong> HTML/CSS with WebRTC camera support (in-progress)</li>
        </ul>
